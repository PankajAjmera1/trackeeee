* 	Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* 	Backend: Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB
* 	Other tools: Git, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code

### Proposed System:
The AirTracker application will be a web application that will be accessible to users on any device with a web browser. The application will use a variety of APIs to fetch flight data and to send price change notifications.
Features:
The following are the key features of the AirTracker application:
* 	Flight search functionality
* 	Ticket price tracking
* 	Price change notification
